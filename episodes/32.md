  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue! Today we’re here to talk about this mythical thing
  called “Work/Life Balance.” We talk about our relationship to development
  right now and its impact on our life. The topic of work hard mentality and
  imposter syndrome is discussed, especially with developers around the world.
  The discussion turns deeper about making time to do other things that are
  important to you, outside of work. Also, we discuss our work life development,
  if we are happy, or if there are any changes we want to make. By the end, we
  hope you'll find some words of inspiration. 


  ## Outline

  [00:01:28] Tessa tells us a little about a blog post by Pine Wu and everyone
  shares their thoughts on being a developer.


  [00:05:37] The panelists tell us what their relationship to development is
  right now and how do they strike that balance.


  [00:15:02] Chris talks about developers around the world, how different their
  work schedule is, and the pressure for developers to make every moment
  optimal. Ari, Ben, and Tessa share their thoughts with the work hard mentality
  and imposter syndrome.


  [00:23:35] Chris talks about the Deci and Ryan Self Determination Theory about
  how humans are motivated and has an awesome personal story to share. ☺


  [00:28:06] Ben shares some thoughts about being in tech, work life balance and
  spending time doing other things that are most important to you. Ari shares
  some thoughts about constantly evaluating what’s important to you.


  [00:33:29] Chris talks about his cognitive capacity and needing cycles in his
  work life and Tessa talks about struggles with employers and co-workers and
  having to be in constant communication with them and being stuck in the same
  cycles.


  [00:37:40] Ari tells us her thoughts on how she keeps work life balance while
  keeping current on skills.


  [00:40:25] Chris and Ben discuss about not needing to have all the answers,
  but it’s good to know how to ask the right questions.


  [00:45:19] Chris shares a story, Ben tells him something inspiring, and Chris,
  Tessa, and Ari tell us personal stories of things that happened to them with
  work related issues.


  [00:48:04] Chris tells us about taking more time for his personal life these
  days and how money to him is just freedom. The panelists tell us where they
  are with their work life development and if they are happy or if they want to
  make changes.

  advice.
