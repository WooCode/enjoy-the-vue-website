  About our guest: Kevin Lewis

  There are so many moving parts to organizing a conference, from seating and
  food, to making sure speakers feel respected, and creating networking
  opportunities for attendees. While the value of face-to-face interaction will
  never go away, there are times when going virtual is a necessary part of your
  event program, like a global pandemic, for instance. Today’s guest is Kevin
  Lewis, a Developer Advocate at Vonage, a Vue.js Developer, and an event
  organizer. In this episode, he shares what it’s like to organize events, the
  shift from IRL to virtual conferences in the wake of COVID-19, the software he
  uses to keep things running smoothly, and what he believes is lost when an
  event goes virtual (like networking). He also talks about some typical
  mistakes organizers make, practical scheduling, and creating opportunities for
  mingling, as well as the importance of over-communicating, his opinions on
  single-track versus multi-track conferences, and CFP or the talk selection
  process. Tune in to find out more!

  feel respected.
