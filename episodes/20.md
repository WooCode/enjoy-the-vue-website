  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, we have special guest, David Khourshid, who
  works at Microsoft doing web development. His interests are mainly with
  animations, front end stuff, State management, and State machines.  We also
  have a guest panelist, Sarah Dayan, who was a past guest on our podcast,
  Episode 11. She is Tech Lead of the Doc Squad at Algolia.  On today’s episode,
  we will talk about State management, State machines, Statecharts, Animations,
  and Compare XState to Vuex, and so much more. Download this episode now!


  ## Outline

  [00:01:28] David explains about XState and the concept of State machines.    


  [00:02:42] In a lot of his talks, David references a paper from 1987, so Tessa
  wonders how David got into State machines and Statecharts.
   
  [00:06:01] Sarah ask David how does it feel to be at the root of this pattern
  rediscovery in the front-end world and how do you feel about seeing those
  tried and true patterns slowly emerging front end? 


  [00:08:44] Ari asks David to give an example of a common scenario that we
  probably have all dealt with where a state machine might be better than
  Boolean state management?


  [00:14:12] Tessa wonders how does David recommend somebody goes from, I don’t
  know what a state machine is to oh, here’s how I can start using them today? 


  [00:14:28] Sarah mentions about David having a visualizer on the XState
  website. She wonders if he’s considered pushing it into something that could
  maybe be a tool and has he considered building something like that to help
  with collaborative work? 


  [00:16:44] David talks about testing, especially end to end testing, and how
  tedious it is. 


  [00:18:33] Tessa is curious if David ever tries to represent piano playing
  with state machine? Piano was his major in college! 


  [00:21:50] Sarah wonders what were David’s big turning points, the big
  realizations that he made as a library author, since he’s at the fourth major
  version in three years of XState now. She also asks him when he decided to
  port XState to Vue, did he encounter major challenges or different challenges
  that were imported into react?


  [00:29:35] Ari talks about having to address this past week, an ongoing
  problem caused by use of a Boolean state. Sarah asks David what are some of
  the most creative applications that he’s seen of XState?


  [00:33:30] Tessa is curious to hear more about how the state machines work
  with scoping of events? 


  [00:36:55] David talks about moving from Vuex to XState.


  [00:42:46} David explains why he would like to see more examples of people
  using state machines in creative ways.


  [00:45:27] Tessa wonders if David has any thoughts or has he seen any
  interesting examples on state machines, potentially opening up a lot more
  interesting avenues to create dynamic or intuitive or accessible user
  interfaces?
