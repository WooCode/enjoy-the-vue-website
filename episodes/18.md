  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today is a panelists episode, your HEROES! The
  topic today is all about Reusable Components.  Find out why props are good for
  some things some of the time, and it’s especially good for situations where
  you want to set some kind of best practice, but then having too many props is
  bad. Slots, Maps, Buttons, and Mixins are discussed as well.  Also, find out
  why Ari said, “Can we throw out any code that doesn’t bring us joy?” ☺



  ## Outline

  [00:01:22] The panelists each tell us what a Reusable Component is.  


  [00:6:20] Chris puts an open-ended question out there to the panelists as to
  when are props good and when are they bad?  When have you regretted using
  props for what kinds of use cases and when are they appropriate? Ari and Tessa
  both share stories.
   
  [00:08:05] When are props useful and when would you want to use a prop over a
  slot? The panelists all discuss. 


  [00:19:04] Chris talks about creating a map, map components, map markers
  component, map layer component, and provide and inject.  There was a good talk
  on the topic of provide and inject using the map example at ConnectTech 2019. 


  [00:21:31] Chris talks about an example using icon components.


  [00:26:05] Chris goes into “buttons” for forms, such as a submit button,
  search button, and inline buttons and Tessa shares some issues with generic
  components. 
   
  [00:29:51] Chris asks the panelists if they’ve used “Mixins?” They have a
  discussion about it with “mixed” reviews.    


  [00:38:50] As a member and representative of the Vue team, Ben tells us some
  things people should know about the Composition API since Vue 3 has not come
  out yet.
