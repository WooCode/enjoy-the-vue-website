  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  On today’s episode we have special guest, Debbie
  O’Brien, Head of Learning and Developer Advocate at Nuxt.js.  Debbie tells us
  all about Nuxt.  She even has an exciting announcement about a new release
  coming soon with Markdown in Nuxt that has the panel super excited! There is
  talk about WordPress Headless CMS and Wiziwig. Also, “Dev Around the Sun,”
  which is online talks from around the world, is discussed.  And lastly, find
  out who did an Escape Room experience on Zoom!  All this and more is just a
  click away!  Download it now.


  ## Outline

  [00:00:49] Debbie tells us what her first framework was and if it wasn’t in
  Vue, how she got into the Vue ecosystem. 


  [00:1:20] Debbie fills us in about Nuxt.  She also explains automatic wrap
  creation and what it does for someone who’s never done Nuxt and how is it
  different than normal Vue applications. 
   
  [00:02:55] Ari asks Debbie if there are any situations where you would need to
  somehow hijack the route guards, or does it just handle all that for you?
  Tessa says the routing feature of Nuxt reminds her of Rails and asks Debbie if
  that is a popular combination to have Rails and Nuxt, and if so, does it make
  it a little bit more challenging to get the automatic routing working?


  [00:04:45] Ben wonders if Debbie’s had any experience with Headless CMS?


  [00:08:02] Debbie has an exciting announcement about Markdown in Nuxt which
  she has been working and it will be released very soon. The panel is EXCITED
  ☺!


  [00:10:20] Tessa asks Debbie if she could go into cases where she thinks Nuxt
  would not be a good fit for a project.  She’s read about when you want to use
  Nuxt, but curious about when you really don’t need Nuxt. 
   
  [00:14:49] Tessa wants Debbie to expand on the idea of not having to pay for
  hosting because it’s static.    


  [00:17:17] Ben goes into WordPress and says he felt that some of the blog
  posts made it sound really easy to set up WordPress Headless CMS and he asks
  Debbie if she found it simple.  Debbie has a funny reply that makes everyone
  laugh ☺  


  [00:22:05] Ben is curious to find out about all these talks Debbie is
  mentioning.  Also, what is she doing since all these conferences have been
  canceled all over the world?


  [00:35:17] Tessa makes a good point and says one thing she feels that’s
  missing from these online experiences is atmospheric sounds, like if everyone
  has their mic on and it’s the same analogous situation and you can hear too
  much at once.  It’s been a very odd adjustment for her, and she wonders if
  it’s been the same for everyone. 


  [00:37:52] Debbie tells us what she’s currently working on and what can people
  look forward to in the next ecosystem.


  [00:42:33] Debbie mentions “Dev Around the Sun” which takes place May 12th,
  and it’s   24 hours of online talks from all different countries and different
  timelines, to raise money for people affected by COVID-19, and she is speaking
  at it.
