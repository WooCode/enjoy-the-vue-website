  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today’s episode is all about Tessa!  Since she’s
  been on our panel, we thought we should introduce her since she’s very
  involved in the Vue community. She has some great stories to tell!   It
  started with art, a Facebook ad for coding bootcamp, programming, editing
  video for students, entering a women’s only program at Grace Hopper, becoming
  a teaching fellow, and getting a concussion!  What?? Download this episode now
  to find out much more about Tessa and even how and why she got started with
  Vue.


  ## Outline

  story that started with her seeing a Facebook ad that she thought was a scam,
  but was it?

  and how it was being in a women’s only coding bootcamp.  Ari tells us about
  her experience at her co-ed coding bootcamp.
