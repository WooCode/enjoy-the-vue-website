  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, our topic is all about Components
  Communication. We will be discussing common situations, questions, and issues
  that we have encountered. Some topics include props down events up, props and
  callbacks, v-bind attrs, $attrs object, v-tool tip component, .native, and
  EventBus.   Also, what is “The Prop Train Pattern?”   Download this episode
  now to find out! 


  ## Outline

  [00:01:32] Tessa heard in the Vue world, the pattern that you want to follow
  is props down events up, but a lot of pieces are a bit vague when it comes to
  abstractions.  Tessa wants to learn more about the specific mechanics behind
  the approach versus something else like passing callbacks?  Chris gives his
  thoughts on this. 


  [00:07:53] Chris explains what .native does. He also gives some great
  recommendations. ☺  
   
  [00:10:36] Tessa wants Chris to expand more on what problems he has seen
  people trying to solve with .native. 


  [00:13:40] Chris recommends some ways for communicating how a component is
  intended to be used in a way that’s more in keeping with props down events up
  versus passing callbacks.  


  [00:16:43] V-bind attrs is explained as well as $attrs object. And Ben talks
  about concerns when people are justifying desire to document the callbacks. 


  [00:19:55] Tessa explains an issue with passing down data you need via props
  and trying to build some kind of structure around that communication. Also,
  having several series of several generations of components and how does she
  get around this issue. Chris clarifies and Ben names it “The Prop Train
  Pattern.” Ari tells us what she does.   


  [00:24:55] Chris talks about using Guillaume’s excellent v-tool tip
  component. 


  [00:26:03] Tessa goes back to Chris’s example of Font Awesome and wants to
  confirm if she has some grandparent that has the Font Awesome data, then it’s
  going through a couple of other component layers to get to the icon component
  layer, can she just put v-bind attrs on the icon component or does she have to
  put that on every component in between as well?  Chris explains. 


  [00:30:01] Ben asks Chris to speak a little bit about the caveats when it
  comes to the reactivity part of refactoring everything to reply and inject. 


  [00:33:24] Ben talks about one of the drawbacks of provide/inject. Chris
  shares some good naming tips and patterns that help developers when they’re
  looking at components. 


  [00:48:00] Tessa brings up the EventBus and if anyone has any thoughts or
  experiences with it.
