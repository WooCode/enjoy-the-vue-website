shownotes: >-
  One of the things we love most as developers are our tools! In this episode,
  we talk about some of our favorite productivity tools, debate the merits of
  different keyboard layouts, how we work as developers and more. And yes, we
  even tackle the infamous tabs vs spaces debate.


  * [00:00:40] The panel goes over their developer tool stack. First
  up…browsers 

  * [00:03:02] What code editors are they all using? 

  * [00:04:39] What Terminal App are they using? Who on the panel is using just
  Terminal??!!! What?!!! Also, Chris Fritz brings up alt keyboard usage and
  terminal themes.

  * [00:09:53] Since they started talking about terminal themes, the group
  wanted to find out what themes they are using in VS Code?  

  * [00:14:21] The BIG question?? Tabs or spaces? 1, 2, or 3?? Chris argues that
  the research shows “2” is the correct answer.    

  * [00:20:32] What is their GIT methodology? 

  * [00:27:12] What are some of the other favorite VS Code extensions that they
  like?

  * [00:30:38] What is everyone’s one productivity app that they like to use?


  ### Picks
   
  * [00:35:28] Ari Clark’s first pick is an app she picked up from Marina
  Mosti’s book “Building Forms with Vue.js” called Mockoon, which allows you to
  mock out servers. Her next pick is a Netflix show called “Diagnosis.” 

  * [00:36:40] Chris Fritz has more Netflix picks this week. A couple of
  episodes from Black Mirror that he watched: “San Junipero” and “Striking
  Vipers”. Chris’s second pick is also for Notion. He uses it for relationships
  as well. 

  * [00:39:58] Elizabeth Fine has a “backup” pick, it’s a Testing Handbook for
  Vue Test Utils by Lachlan Miller. 

  * [00:40:29] Ben Hong wraps up this week’s picks with the Anime “Dr Stone”
  available on Crunchy Roll. Of course, as revealed in the productivity segment,
  Notion is one of Ben’s other picks this week.
